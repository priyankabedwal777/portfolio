    "Hi, I’m Priyanka 👋 – a Frontend Developer who believes websites shouldn’t just work, they should delight! For nearly 2 years, I’ve been on a mission to turn coffee into clean code and pixels into perfection. My best friends? React & Next.js (we hang out a lot). My hobbies? Making users happy, squashing bugs, and finding the perfect shade of blue for buttons (it’s an art 🎨). When I’m not coding, I’m probably learning a new tool, exploring design trends, or celebrating that npm install worked on the first try. Looking for someone who writes code, cares about UX, and adds a dash of creativity? That’s me! Let’s build something amazing together. 🚀"
